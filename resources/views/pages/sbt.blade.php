    <h2>About Us</h2>
    <p style="text-align: justify;text-justify: inter-word;">
      Universitas Indonesia Solar Boat Team (UI SBT), is a group of engineering
      students of the Universitas Indonesia that have an interest in the field of
      renewable energy, particularly in the field of solar energy. It is triggered
      by the issue of global warming are rife discussed by the world community.
      Departing from this, we as a UI student wants to contribute in the fields
      of environment, but still not forgotten our basic as engineering students.
      After doing considerable research done on what to focus on, we agreed to
      develop and create a solar-powered boat. In order to have a goal to be achieved,
      our team participate on a race of solar-powered ship on the international
      level, the Dutch Solar Challenge or now renamed as Solar Sport One.

    <h2>Project</h2>
    <h3>#1 Jayasatria Garuda (Si Jagur)</h3>
    <p>Jayasatria Garuda (Si Jagur) is the first ship of our team, this solar
      powered ship was made in 2016 by Solar Boat Team UI 2016. The ship was
      participating in Dong Solar Challenge (DSC 2016), in A class. Our ship,
      Si Jagur, managed to carve his name into the <b>TOP 15 in the world level,
      and ranked second position in Asia level.</b>
